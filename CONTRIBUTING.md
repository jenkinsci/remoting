These recommendations are available [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing).

### Proposing changes

* Create pull requests (PRs) against the master branch.
* Bug fixes or performance improvements may be a subject for backporting to Remoting 2.x.
If you need it, please mention it in the pull request or JIRA ticket. 

### Q&A

Use the [Jenkins developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev) to sync-up with remoting developers.
In the case of the mailing list, it's a good practice to CC maintainers directly.
