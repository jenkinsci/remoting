                   To avoid fragmentation of the pipe window, at least demand that 10% of the pipe window
                   be reclaimed.

                   Imagine a large latency network where we are always low on the window size,
                   and we are continuously sending data of irregular size. In such a circumstance,
                   a fragmentation will happen. We start sending out a small Chunk at a time (say 4 bytes),
                   and when its Ack comes back, it gets immediately consumed by another out-bound Chunk of 4 bytes.

                   Clearly, it's better to wait a bit until we have a sizable pipe window, then send out
                   a bigger Chunk, since Chunks have static overheads. This code does just that.

                   (Except when what we are trying to send as a whole is smaller than the current available
                   window size, in which case there's no point in waiting.)
                */

                   Imagine if we have a lot of data to send and the pipe window is fully available.
                   If we create one Chunk that fully uses the window size, we need to wait for the
                   whole Chunk to get to the other side, then the Ack to come back to this side,
                   before we can send a next Chunk. While the Ack is traveling back to us, we have
                   to sit idle. This fails to utilize available bandwidth.

                   A better strategy is to create a smaller Chunk, say half the window size.
                   This allows the other side to send back the ack while we are sending the second
                   Chunk. In a network with a non-trivial latency, this allows Chunk and Ack
                   to overlap, and that improves the utilization.

                   It's not clear what the best size of the chunk to send (there's a certain
                   overhead in our Command structure, around 100-200 bytes), so I'm just starting
                   with 2. Further analysis would be needed to determine the best value.
